# Configuration for Alacritty, the GPU enhanced terminal emulator
# Any items in the `env` entry below will be added as
# environment variables. Some entries may override variables
# set by alacritty it self.
env:
  # TERM env customization. Default is xterm-256color
  # Note: the default TERM value `xterm-256color` does not
  # specify all features alacritty supports. This does pose
  # a few issues with programs relying on terminfo and the
  # `tput` command.
  COLORTERM: truecolor
  TERM: xterm-256color
